 * Description :
 * The function responsible for triggering the Timer0 with the PWM Mode.
 * Setup the PWM mode with Non-Inverting.
 * Setup the prescaler with F_CPU/8.
 * Setup the compare value based on the required input duty cycle
 * Setup the direction for OC0 as output pin through the GPIO driver.
 * The generated PWM signal frequency will be 500Hz to control the DC Motor speed.
